        <p>
            Chicken parm is one of my favorite foods. Heres a quick recipe of how to make it.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>4 Slices of Fresh Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray. 
                Place chicken on the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 12 minutes. 
                Remove from the oven, add desired amount of sauce, and top each breast with mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 12 more minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            
        </ol>
